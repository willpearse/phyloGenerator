      <h1>Necessities</h1>
      <h3>Who should I cite?</h3>
	  <p>There is a Methods in Ecology and Evolution paper that is in press (coming out in a matter of days) that describes this program - please contact me for details if you need to cite the program right now. Please also ensure you cite the programs phyloGenerator uses (see below).</p>
  <h3>Where can I find out more details of how this program runs?</h3>
  <p>A paper describing phyloGenerator is currently under review, but once (if!) it's accepted somewhere a link to the paper will appear on the site. Until then, a copy of the manuscript is <a href="http://willpearse.com/ ">available from the lead author on request</a>.</p>
      <h3>What programs does this use? And how do I cite them?</h3>
	  <p>Only cite the programs you use from the following list:</p>
	  <ul>
		  <li><a href="http://www.exelixis-lab.org/">RAxML - 7.3.0</a></li>
		  <li><a href="http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Main_Page">BEAST - 1.7.1</a></li>
		  <li><a href="http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/">MUSCLE - 3.8.31</a></li>
		  <li><a href="http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/">MAFFT - v6.847b</a></li>
		  <li><a href="http://www.clustal.org/omega/">Clustal-Omega - 1.0.3</a></li>
		  <li><a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/goldman-srv/prank/prank/">PRANK - v.100701</a></li>
		  <li><a href="http://www.phylodiversity.net/phylocom/">Phylomatic - 4.2</a> (part of Phylocom)</li>
		  <li><a href="http://kumiho.smith.man.ac.uk/whelan/software/metal/">MetAl - 1.1</a> (compiled by me)</li>
		  <li><a href="http://trimal.cgenomics.org/">TrimAl - 1.2rev59</a></li>
		 </ul>
		 <p>But you <b>must</b> cite <a href="http://www.biopython.org/wiki/Main_Page">BioPython</a>. Sorry not to be more help than this, but it's best the authors tell you what to cite so I don't get in trouble!</p>
		<h3>I get errors when I download sequences - something about DTD files!</h3>
		<p>This isn't a bug, it's a 'feature'. In other words, this doesn't affect your download. Just leave the program running; your sequences are being downloaded and interpreted correctly.</p>
		<h3>My phylogeny doesn't look anything like it should do. What's gone wrong?</h3>
		<p>In my experience, it's rare for phyloGenerator not to give you a good result, but bear in mind that no one can write an automated program that works every time with something like this - otherwise there wouldn't be phylogeneticists in the first place! For difficult projects, there's not likely to be a quick solution. Sorry. Please do contact me because I like to know when runs haven't worked. However, there are two major sources of error that phyloGenerator can help with: absence of a constraint tree, or a bad alignment.</p>
		<p>Use Phylomatic to make a constraint, take one from a paper - whatever - that way you <emph>can't</emph> get something you wouldn't expect. If you're using a dated phylogeny, make sure you <emph>name</emph> the dated clades in your phylogeny - something like '((A:2,B:2), C:3)Named.clade:5' as oppose to '((A:2, B:2), C:3):5'.</p>
		<p>Check your alignment. phyloGenerator will warn you (the column marked 'warn') if your alignments seem too long. Output them, open them in a program like Clustal-X2, and see if there are long stretches of gaps, or an alignment that doesn't look like a set of neatly-lined-up sequences. If you find that, go back to the sequence download stage, trim your sequences, check the lengths, and maybe think about using TrimAl in the alignment stage.</p>
		<p>Finally, you may find some species are on <emph>incredibly</emph> long branches, or that your smoothed phylogeny with PATHd8 have lots of polytomies (multiple branches coming from the same node). The later is caused by the former, because the long branches make the small branches look so small they get averaged down to zero length by PATHd8. The solution is to find better sequences for those long-branch species (see the section on DNA download in the guide), or, if that doesn't work, to try adding in a few more species that are relatives of that long branch group. If you can't fix this problem using these methods, do <a href="http://willpearse.com/">drop me an email</a>, but you may have hit a problem that requires the expertise of a phylogeneticist. Sorry!</p>
		<h3>I can't get PATHd8 to work on a PC!</h3>
		<p>First, try installing Cygwin (type 'cygwin' when prompted to go to their website). If that doesn't work, you can try copying a DLL into the 'requires' folder inside the 'phyloGenerator' folder on your computer - again, you can download this when prompted too. If that doesn't work, please <a href="http://willpearse.com/">contact me</a>. Those two steps have worked for everyone so far, but if they don't for you I want to know!</p>
		<h3>Whenever my PC uses BEAST, phyloGenerator crashes/suddenly exits.</h3>
		<p>BEAST uses something called Java, and it seems that some Windows PCs have been configured to have multiple copies of Java on their computer, but by default the oldest version of Java is used. This causes problems for BEAST, and so it crashes. You need to modify your 'PATH' variable so that its first entry is the directory where your latest Java installation is <a href="http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/uploadfile/941fc8/set-path-for-java-in-windows-xp/">(here is a walkthrough a friend found helpful)</a>. Note that you'll probably want to add something like 'C:\Program Files\Java\java16\bin'. A good way of making sure it's this problem is to go into the 'requires' folder inside phyloGenerator, and double-click on 'BEAST v1.7.1.exe'. If that won't run, you need to update your version of Java (try the 'Java' section of Control Panel), and if it does then you need to follow the instructions above. I'm sorry that I can't automate this for you, but if you run into problems do <a href="http://willpearse.com/">drop me an email</a>. Only one person has had this problem (to my knowledge!) if that's of any consolation!</p>
		 <h3>How can I exit phyloGenerator in the middle of a run?</h3>
		 <p>Press 'control-c' a few times. On a PC, you'll get a dialogue box warning of an error - just hit enter and ignore it. Doing so during a RAxML run will cause problems - see below</p>
		<h3>I exited phyloGenerator in the middle of a RAxML run, and now it won't work.</h3>
		<p>You've got a temporary file on your computer that's stopping RAxML running. Search for all files containing 'RAxML_' (note the capitalisation), and remove them if they're anywhere near phyloGenerator or have the word 'temp' in them. Otherwise, just install a fresh copy of phyloGenerator.</p>
		 <h3>I can't load any files, or even start phyloGenerator, despite using the correct path</h3>
		 <p>Make sure you are using the correct, full, absolute path. For example, 'Demos/Silwood_Plants/sequences.fasta' is an incomplete absolute path, but '/Users/will/Documents/phyloGenerator/Demo/Silwood_Plants/sequences.fasta' is a complete, full path.</p>
		 <p>Also, if you're dragging and dropping files into phyloGenerator when it asks for them, make sure there are no trailing spaces at the end of your filename. If in doubt, press delete - if the file path doesn't appear to change, you had some trailing spaces.</p>
<p>If your folders or files have spaces in them, most computer programs (including phyloGenerator) run into problems. On a Windows computer, putting the file and its path in double quotes (e.g., "C:\My folder\My file.txt"), and on a Mac/UNIX 'escaping' the space with a backslash (e.g., "/My\ Path/My\ file.txt") will help. If in doubt, drag-and-drop the file into your Terminal/Command Prompt to see how your computer wants the file referenced.</p>
		 <h3>It warns me that a blank input wasn't recognised, or an input I typed in doesn't work.</h3>
		 <p>You might have hit a button while the program was running earlier and it remembered that. Try entering the command again, but if you still get problems <a href="http://willpearse.com/">contact me</a>.</p>
		 <h3>phyloGenerator keeps hanging and not doing anything!</h3>
		 <p>I've set phyloGenerator to pause every ten times it downloads something for five seconds, so as not to overload the NCBI database. However, I'm being massively conservative, and if you want to alter that (at your own risk!) then play around with the 'delay' argument when running phyloGenerator. Many of the programs phyloGenerator calls take quite a while too - if you can hear your computer whirring, it's probably just building your phylogeny.</p>
		 <p>If you're aligning sequences and it seems to be taking forever, make sure there are no abnormally long sequences in your dataset. If most of your sequences are 1000bp long, and one or two are >10000bp long, you'll need to trim the sequences or you'll crash most alignment programs.</p>
		<h3>I keep getting funny characters in my species names (backslashes, accented characters, etc.)</h3>
		<p>Make sure you have <emph>no formatting whatsoever</emph> in your input files. You may non-breaking spaces or meta-characters inserted by Microsoft Word. If in doubt, copy and paste your input file into a really simple text editor (Notepad, TextEdit, something like that) and manually type in the species that are giving you problems.</p>
		 <h3>I keep getting warned about server errors</h3>
		 <p>This is nothing to worry about, unless it crashes phyloGenerator or causes it to exit. If either of those things happen, consider not downloading as many species (more than six hundred seems to cause it problems, and I've not designed this program to handle that many), but please do <a href="http://willpearse.com/">send me an email</a> about it.</p>
		 <h3>Can I run two instances of phyloGenerator at a time!</h3>
		 <p>Sorry, you can't. Only one run at a time, as the temporary files phyloGenerator uses can get confused and you can get strange results.</p>
		<h3>How do I make the command prompt larger (Windows only)</h3>
		<p>Click on command prompt's icon (top-left of the screen), click properties, then got to layout and change the screen width.</p>
		 <h3>I don't understand what this program does! Help!</h3>
		 <p>Have a read through the walkthrough. If that doesn't help, drop me an email. I'm afraid I can't explain the whole of phylogenetics to you (sorry!) but I'm quite likely to help you if you send me a polite email. Even more so if you promise me a beer!</p>
		 <h3>I don't think this program is a good idea. It doesn't include method X / philsophically it's a bad idea / etc.</h3>
		 <p>I probably agree with you. Please, <a href="http://willpearse.com/">send me an email</a> and let's talk about it. Maybe we can improve the program, but at the very least I'd appreciate your feedback. For the record, I certainly don't think this program is a replacement for phylogeneticists.</p>
		 <h3>It doesn't work! Help!</h3>
		 <p>Oh no! <a href="http://willpearse.com/">Send me</a> a copy-pasted version of everything you did and got back from phyloGenerator, any files you gave to phyloGenerator, and details about your computer (Mac? Windows? What version?). I'm always grateful for feedback (even errors!), and I'll try and help you as soon as I can. Make sure you read all the FAQs above first, though!</p>
